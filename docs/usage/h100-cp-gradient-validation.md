# H100 canonical CP backward validation

The original 0.021213% gradient-norm discrepancy was between **training
TP2/CP4 and TP4/CP2**, both with rollout TP4/CP1. The new two-step runs have
identical gradient norms, sampled tokens, and all 399 exported model parameters
at initialization and after each Adam update.

| Training topology | Step 0 gradient norm | Step 1 gradient norm |
|---|---:|---:|
| TP2/CP4 | 0.022594607365076035 | 0.03439536852782456 |
| TP4/CP2 | 0.022594607365076035 | 0.03439536852782456 |

All three weight-version comparisons have **0 differing parameter tensors**;
the versions change after each update. Each run also compares 8,192 active
training/rollout logprobs with **0 byte mismatches**. The shared weight hashes
and complete validation records are in
[the evidence JSON](evidence/pr432-20260920/h100-cp-gradient.json).

## Change

Packed CP parameter gradients now reconstruct logical sample/token order,
remove padding, and cancel the CP loss multiplier before summation. This covers
attention projections, FFN, RMSNorm (including TP-sharded Q/K heads), and
embedding gradients. Activation checkpoint recomputation retains the same CP
layout as the original forward pass.

Megatron's L2 norm now sums FP32 gradient squares using integer exponent bins
before the distributed reduction. It controls real gradient clipping; it does
not round logged values or impose a comparison tolerance. NVRTC compiles the
CUDA kernel once per process/device. An HIPRTC route is included but has not
been GPU-validated on ROCm. The H100 runner enables these changes for the
all-RL-Kernel arms; the native baseline remains unchanged. Weight auditing
hashes every exported tensor when update verification is requested.

## Reproduce

With the existing machine profile, run each command after the other completes:

```bash
./rlk run --steps 2 --require-updates --tp 2 --rollout-tp 4 \
  --temperature 0.7 --top-p 0.95 --max-response-len 512 --kl-coef 0.01
./rlk run --steps 2 --require-updates --tp 4 --rollout-tp 4 \
  --temperature 0.7 --top-p 0.95 --max-response-len 512 --kl-coef 0.01
```

Recorded development runs: `cpgrad-tp2cp4-r5`, `cpgrad-tp4cp2-r5`.
These used the isolated working tree based on `6737448b`, with the accompanying
CP/norm changes and `--allow-dirty`; both Ray jobs and acceptance checks passed.
After the full runs, the norm helper gained a device-context guard; its
single-device and alternate-device GPU regression checks both passed.

## Timing and scope

Second-step measured times include complete weight export, reload, and auditing:

| Training topology | Actor training | Entire step |
|---|---:|---:|
| TP2/CP4 | 3.611 s | 42.435 s |
| TP4/CP2 | 3.233 s | 41.616 s |

TP2/CP4 takes about 2.0% longer for this entire step (11.7% for actor training).
Only two steps were measured. The audit adds substantial overhead; these
numbers are not a new controlled comparison against native or steady-state
throughput. A separate 10M-element BF16-derived FP32 norm microbenchmark took
about 0.36 ms on H100.

Responses were capped at 512 tokens and all truncated; nonzero gradients came
from KL=0.01, with zero policy-gradient advantages. This establishes the
observed pair, not every topology, reward scenario, microbatch packing,
temperature/top-p combination, or cross-platform identity. In particular,
the canonical TP is still derived from the finer training/rollout TP, and
changing CP can change packing when the token budget splits the batch.

## Rollout CP2: actual failure

`vime200-rollout-cp2-verify-r1` actually launched training TP4/CP2 and rollout
TP4/CP2 on eight H100s, with temperature 0.7 and top-p 0.95. vLLM 0.16.0 failed
before generation with:

```text
AssertionError: PCP requires attention impls' support, but the impl RlKernelAttentionImpl does not support PCP.
```

The CLI forwards prefill CP but the backend does not implement the required
token/KV partition and attention merge. No rollout CP2 numerical pass was
obtained. Setting `supports_pcp=True` alone would not implement PCP. ROCm was
not rerun for this follow-up.
